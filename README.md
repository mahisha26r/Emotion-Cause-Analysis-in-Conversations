# NLP-Project---Group-25: Emotion Cause Analysis in Conversations Using Textual Data
Course project of CSE556: Natural Language Processing Winter Semester 2024

## Submitted To:
### Dr Md. Shad Akhtar (Instructor of CSE556 Course)
### Mr Nimesh Yadav (Head TA of CSE556 Course)
### Other TAs of the CSE556 Course


## About The Project:
### This project aims to create a deep-learning model for emotion recognition in conversation (ERC), identifying emotion from the cause utterance in conversation and Cause pair identification in the conversations of textual data. This method will help different researchers create better AI-based conversational systems in the future.
